# Personal Scripts

This is a respository containing various random scripts I've created for personal use over the years.
The ones without a file extension are the ones meant to be executed, so if you want to use them do a `chmod +x <filename>` on 'em and add the repository to your `$PATH`.

## Versioning
- The Ruby scripts have been tested to work on _at least_ version 2.3.7.
- The Python scripts have been tested to work with version 3.7.x
